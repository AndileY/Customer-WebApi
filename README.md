The Customer class represents the customer model.
CustomerService implements the CRUD operations for managing customer data.
The ICustomerService interface ensures that the service methods are defined.
The CustomerDbContext connects to the database, and DbSet<Customer> allows querying the Customers table.
CustomController handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate methods in CustomerService.
This setup is a basic example of creating a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and Dependency Injection to manage customer data.
When an incoming request reaches the server, it first passes through the ApiKeyAuthenticationMiddleware, where the API key is validated.
Next, it goes through the BasicAuthorizationMiddleware, where Basic Authentication is performed.
If the request passes both authentication checks, it proceeds to the controllers, where API endpoints are mapped.
